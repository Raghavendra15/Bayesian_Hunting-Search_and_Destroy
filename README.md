# Bayesian Hunting: Search and Destroy
To start the project run "run.py"

Abstract: 

This project aims at building an agent for searching the target hidden across 4 different types
of terrains. The purpose of this assignment is to model your knowledge/belief
about a system probabilistically, and use this belief state to efficiently direct
future action.

This is a situation frequently confronted by artificial intelligence agents operating
in the world - based on current information, they must decide how to act,
balancing both achieving a goal and collecting new information. Additionally,
this project stresses the importance of formulation and representation. There
are a number of roughly equivalent ways to express and solve this problem. But
we will resort to Bayesian update, Where we factor new information as we search along to update our prior beliefs about the system.
